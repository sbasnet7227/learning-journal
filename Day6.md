# Introduction to Loops:
- Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run and the loops keeps running until the condition false.

## Types of LOOPS:
- For Loop
    - This  kind of loop runs the code for specific number of times. It is the most common loop. In a 'for loop' , the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.

        for (var i = 0; i< n ; i++){

            }
    - For loop has three parts: first one is Initialization, second is Condition and third is Update.
- While Loop
    - If we do not know how many times the code should run, we can use a while loop. Condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.
    > while (check contidion) {
        // block of codes execute here
        counter increment or decrement
        }

- Do While Loop
    - The do- while loop is very similar to while loop but has one key difference. it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once even though the condition is false.

    > do {
        // execute first
        then check the condition using while loop
        
        }while (check condition)
