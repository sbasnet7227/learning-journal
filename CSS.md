### CSS
- CSS means Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS can control the layout of a page.
- CSS makes page attractive and beautiful.
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change and the values of the properties. eg: the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a seperate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
